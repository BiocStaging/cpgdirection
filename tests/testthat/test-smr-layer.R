# Regression tests for two bugs found in 2.2.3, both of which returned a
# plausible answer rather than an error, and so would not have been caught by
# anything already in the suite.
#
# 1. The parser required more than two underscore-separated tokens, so the
#    plainest identifier a user would type -- "cg00039463_TRAP1" -- lost its
#    gene entirely and the whole distance layer went unavailable.
#
# 2. The SMR layer keyed its join on requested_gene only. With no gene supplied
#    the key was NA, so the layer could never fire in the mode most people run.
#    Every S1/S2/S3 figure was correct, and none of it reached the user.
